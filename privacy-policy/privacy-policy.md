# Privacy Policy — Currency Converter (by UzorGame)

**Last updated:** November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how UzorGame (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information in the mobile app **“Currency Converter”**.

The app works **without accounts**, **without ads**, **without tracking users across apps**, and **without uploading your data to our servers**.  
All settings stay **locally on your device**.

## 1) What data is processed

### We do not collect personal data

We do **not** ask for your name, email, phone number, contacts, location, or any identifying information.  
We do **not** upload application usage to our own servers.

The app does not access your photos, contacts, files, or any sensitive permissions.

---

## 2) Firebase Analytics (non-personal, technical data)

The app uses **Google Firebase Analytics** to understand basic usage (e.g. which screens are viewed, app crashes, number of active users).

Firebase may process:

- app version and device type  
- app interactions (e.g., which screens are opened)  
- crash reports  
- country (coarse, based on IP), but we do not receive precise location  

Firebase **does not** give us access to your identity, IP address, or any personal data.  
All processing is done according to Google’s privacy policies.

---

## 3) Currency API (exchange rates)

The app requests up-to-date currency exchange rates from a **third-party API provider**.

- API requests do **not** include personal information  
- API requests do **not** contain user identifiers  
- The external provider receives only a standard anonymous HTTPS request asking for currency data

We do not control how external providers store or use their own server logs.  
No user-identifying data is sent.

## 4) Children’s Privacy

The app is suitable for a general audience and is **not directed at children**.  
Since we do not collect personal data, we do not knowingly collect information from children.

---

## 5) Data storage & retention

- No personal data is collected or stored.  
- App settings are stored **locally on your device**.  
- Any technical analytics handled by Firebase follow Google’s retention policies.  
- You may disable Analytics in your device’s Google settings (Android).

---

## 6) Data sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or share any user data.  
Technical data may be processed solely by:

- **Google Firebase** (analytics, crash reports)  
- **Currency API provider** (exchange rate requests)

We do not share data with any other third parties.

---

## 7) Security

We do not operate databases or store user profiles.  
All communication with the currency API is done via secure HTTPS connection.

To stay protected, keep your device updated.
