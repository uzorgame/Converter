# Privacy Policy — Currency Converter (by UzorGame)

**Last updated:** November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how UzorGame (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information in the mobile app **“Currency Converter”**.  
We designed the app to work **without creating accounts** and **without uploading your usage data to our servers**. All settings and preferences are stored **locally on your device**.

## 1) What data is processed

**We do not directly collect personal data.**  
We do not ask for your name, email, phone number, contacts, or precise location, and we do not run our own analytics servers.

### Advertising (Google AdMob)

For ad delivery, measurement, fraud-prevention and abuse detection, Google and its ad partners may process:

- device and app information (app version, OS, model);  
- advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID);  
- IP address and coarse location;  
- ad interactions (impressions, clicks, rewards).

**Ad personalization depends on your consent and device settings.**  
If you decline personalized ads, we request **non-personalized ads**. Google may still process limited data (e.g., for fraud prevention and basic measurement).

See Google’s policies below.

---

## 2) Consent in EEA/UK (UMP)

On first launch in the EEA/UK region, the app uses Google’s **User Messaging Platform (UMP)** to request your advertising consent under the IAB TCF framework.  
Your choice is stored by the Google SDK and used for all ad requests.

You can change your choice at any time in the app:  
**Settings → Privacy** (opens the UMP privacy options form).

---

## 3) Children’s privacy

Our app targets a general audience and is **not directed to children**.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, contact **uzorplay@gmail.com**, and we will take appropriate action.

If the app is ever enrolled in Google Play’s **Families** program, we will comply with all required child-directed rules and AdMob restrictions.

## 4) Data storage & retention

- We do **not** maintain user databases.  
- We do **not** upload your usage history or preferences to our servers.  
- Ad-related data is processed and retained by **Google** according to their own policies.  
- You can reset your **Google Advertising ID** in Android settings at any time.

---

## 5) Data sharing / “sale”

- We **do not sell** or trade your data.  
- Ad data is handled solely by **Google AdMob** and its certified partners to show and measure ads.

For California users: we do not “sell” personal information under the CCPA.  
To limit ad personalization, adjust the in-app **Privacy** options, Android **Ads** settings, and Google **Ads Personalization** settings.

---

## 6) Legal bases (GDPR / EEA)

Where GDPR applies, processing performed by Google for advertising is based on:

- **your consent** (for personalized ads), or  
- **legitimate interests** (e.g., fraud-prevention, basic measurement).

We ourselves do not perform any additional processing beyond what is explicitly described here.

---

## 7) Your choices & controls

- **In-app:** Settings → **Privacy** (UMP privacy options form)  
- **Device:** Android Settings → Privacy / Ads → reset or limit ad personalization  
- **Google Ads Settings:** manage your ad personalization globally

---

## 8) Security

We do not operate user databases or cloud storage.  
Advertising delivery and measurement are performed by Google, which uses industry-standard security and protection mechanisms.

Keep your device updated to ensure maximum security.

## 9) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
